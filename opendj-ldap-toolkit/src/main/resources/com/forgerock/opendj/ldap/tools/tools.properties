INFO_SEARCHRATE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION=This utility can be used to measure \
  search throughput and response time of a directory service using \
  user-defined searches.\n\n\
  Example:\n\n\ \ searchrate -p 1389 -D "cn=directory manager" -w password \\\n\
  \ \ \ \ -F -c 4 -t 4 -b "dc=example,dc=com" -g "rand(0,2000)" "(uid=user.%%d)"\n\n\
  Before trying the example, import 2000 randomly generated users
INFO_ADDRATE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION=This utility can be used to measure \
  add and optionally delete throughput and response time of a directory server using \
  user-defined entries. \
  The {template-file-path} argument identifies a template file \
  that has the same form as a template file for the makeldif command.\n\
  \nExamples:\n \  This example adds entries and randomly deletes them while \
  the number of entries added is greater than 10,000: \n \
  addrate -p 1389 -f -c 10 -C random -s 10000 addrate.template \n \
  This example adds entries and starts to delete them in the same \
  order if their age is greater than a certain time: \n \
  addrate -p 1389 -f -c 10 -C fifo -a 2 addrate.template\n\n\
  For details about the template file, see makeldif.template
INFO_SEARCHRATE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_BASEDN=Base DN format string.
INFO_MODRATE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION=This utility can be used to measure \
  modify throughput and response time of a directory service using \
  user-defined modifications.\n\n\

  \ \ \ \ -F -c 4 -t 4 -b "uid=user.%%d,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" \\\n\
  \ \ \ \ -g "rand(0,2000)" -g "randstr(16)" 'description:%%2$s'\n\n\
  Before trying the example, import 2000 randomly generated users
INFO_MODRATE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_TARGETDN=Target entry DN format string
INFO_AUTHRATE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION=This utility can be used to measure \
  bind throughput and response time of a directory service using \
  user-defined bind or search-then-bind operations.\n\nFormat strings may be \
  used in the bind DN option as well as the authid and authzid SASL bind \
  options. A search operation may be used to retrieve the bind DN by \
  specifying the base DN and a filter. The retrieved entry DN will be appended \
  as the last argument in the argument list when evaluating format strings.\n\n\
  Example (bind only):\n\n\ \ authrate -p 1389 -D "uid=user.%%d,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" \\\n\
  \ \ \ \  -w password -f -c 10 -g "rand(0,2000)"\n\n\
  Example (search then bind):\n\n\ \ authrate -p 1389 -D '%%2$s' -w password -f -c 10 \\\n\
  \ \ \ \ -b "ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" -s one -g "rand(0,2000)" "(uid=user.%%d)"\n\n\
