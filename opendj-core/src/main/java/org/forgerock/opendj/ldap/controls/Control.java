 * those sent by servers are termed 'response controls'.
 * <p>
 * To determine whether a directory server supports a given control, read the
 * list of supported controls from the root DSE to get a collection of control
 * OIDs, and then check for a match:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Connection connection = ...;
 * Collection<String> supported =
 *     RootDSE.readRootDSE(connection).getSupportedControls();
 *
 * Control control = ...;

 *     // The control is supported. Use it here...
 * }
