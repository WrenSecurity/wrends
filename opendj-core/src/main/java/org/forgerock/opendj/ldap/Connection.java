/**
 * A connection with a Directory Server over which read and update operations
 * may be performed. See RFC 4511 for the LDAPv3 protocol specification and more
 * information about the types of operations defined in LDAP.
 *
 * <h3>Operation processing</h3>
 * <p>
 * Operations may be performed synchronously or asynchronously depending on the
 * method chosen. Asynchronous methods can be identified by their {@code Async}
 * suffix.
 *
 * <h4>Performing operations synchronously</h4>
 * <p>
 * Synchronous methods block until a response is received from the Directory
 * Server, at which point an appropriate {@link Result} object is returned if
 * the operation succeeded, or thrown as an {@link LdapException} if the
 * operation failed.
 * <p>
 * Since synchronous operations block the calling thread, the only way to
 * abandon a long running operation is to interrupt the calling thread from
 * another thread. This will cause the calling thread unblock and throw a
 * {@link CancelledResultException} whose cause is the underlying
 * {@link InterruptedException}.
 *
 * <h4>Performing operations asynchronously</h4>
 * <p>
 * Asynchronous methods, identified by their {@code Async} suffix, are
 * non-blocking, returning a {@link LdapPromise} or sub-type thereof which can
 * be used for retrieving the result using the {@link LdapPromise#get} method.
 * Operation failures, for whatever reason, are signaled by the
 * {@link LdapPromise#get()} method throwing an {@link LdapException}.
 * <p>
 * In addition to returning a {@link LdapPromise}, all asynchronous methods
 * accept a {@link LdapResultHandler} which will be notified upon completion of the
 * operation.
 * <p>
 * Synchronous operations are easily simulated by immediately getting the
 * result:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Connection connection = ...;
 * AddRequest request = ...;
 * // Will block until operation completes, and
 * // throws exception on failure.
 * connection.add(request).get();
 * </pre>
 *
 * Operations can be performed in parallel while taking advantage of the
 * simplicity of a synchronous application design:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Connection connection1 = ...;
 * Connection connection2 = ...;
 * AddRequest request = ...;
 * // Add the entry to the first server (don't block).
 * LdapPromise promise1 = connection1.add(request);
 * // Add the entry to the second server (in parallel).
 * LdapPromise promise2 = connection2.add(request);
 * // Total time = is O(1) instead of O(n).
 * promise1.get();
 * promise2.get();
 * </pre>
 *
 * More complex client applications can take advantage of a fully asynchronous
 * event driven design using {@link LdapResultHandler}s:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Connection connection = ...;
 * SearchRequest request = ...;
 * // Process results in the search result handler
 * // in a separate thread.
 * SearchResponseHandler handle = ...;
 * connection.search(request, handler);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Closing connections</h3>
 * <p>
 * Applications must ensure that a connection is closed by calling
 * {@link #close()} even if a fatal error occurs on the connection. Once a
 * connection has been closed by the client application, any attempts to
 * continue to use the connection will result in an
 * {@link IllegalStateException} being thrown. Note that, if a fatal error is
 * encountered on the connection, then the application can continue to use the
 * connection. In this case all requests subsequent to the failure will fail
 * with an appropriate {@link LdapException} when their result is
 * retrieved.
 *
 * <h3>Event notification</h3>
 * <p>
 * Applications can choose to be notified when a connection is closed by the
 * application, receives an unsolicited notification, or experiences a fatal
 * error by registering a {@link ConnectionEventListener} with the connection
 * using the {@link #addConnectionEventListener} method.
 *
 * @see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511">RFC 4511 - Lightweight
 *      Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol </a>
