    <section name="About the Wren:DS Project">
      <p>The Wren:DS community actively develops open source directory services,
      including a high performance, highly available, secure directory server,
      built-in data replication, client tools, and an LDAP SDK. Wren:DS offers
      extensive LDAPv3 support, as well as RESTful access to directory data over
      HTTP. Wren:DS DSML gateway enables applications accessing directory data
      through DSMLv2. All modules are 100% Java based and require at least
      Java 11.</p>
