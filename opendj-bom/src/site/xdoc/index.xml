  <section name="About the OpenDJ Project">
   <p>The OpenDJ community actively develops open source directory services,
   including a high performance, highly available, secure directory server,
   built-in data replication, client tools, and an LDAP SDK. OpenDJ offers
   extensive LDAPv3 support, as well as RESTful access to directory data over
   HTTP. OpenDJ DSML gateway enables applications accessing directory data
   through DSMLv2. All modules are 100% Java based and require at least
   Java 6.<a href="https://java.net/attachments/wiki_images/adoptopenjdk/compat.svg.png">

   >OpenDJ Roadmap</a>, you see that the community plans to develop directory
   proxy services with virtual directory capabilities such as data mapping and
   connectors for non-directory data sources.</p>
